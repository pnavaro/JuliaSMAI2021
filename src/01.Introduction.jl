#md # # Why Julia?
#md #
#md # - Started in 2009 and first version was released in 2012.
#md # - High-level languages like Python and R let one explore and experiment rapidly, but can run slow.
#md # - Low-level languages like Fortran/C++ tend to take longer to develop, but run fast.
#md # - This is sometimes called the "two language problem" and is something the Julia developers set out to eliminate.
#md # - Julia's promise is to provide a "best of both worlds" experience for programmers who need to develop novel algorithms and bring them into production environments with minimal effort.
